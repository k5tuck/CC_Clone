## 🔄 How It Works

### Message Flow
```
User Input
    ↓
OrchestratorBridge (Intent Detection)
    ↓
    ├─→ Query → StreamingClient → LLM → Buffer → UI
    ├─→ Task → Orchestrator → Agents → UI
    └─→ Command → Handler → UI
         ↓
ConversationHistoryManager (Persistence)
```

### Key Interactions

1. **User types message and presses Enter**
2. **Intent is detected:**
   - `/command` → Command handler
   - "implement/create/build..." → Task executor
   - Everything else → LLM chat

3. **Response streams back:**
   - Tokens buffered for smooth display
   - Cursor shows streaming in progress
   - Context maintained across conversation

4. **History is saved:**
   - User and assistant messages stored
   - Context window managed automatically
   - Export/import available anytime

---

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why Streaming?
- **Immediate feedback** - Users see responses forming
- **Better UX** - No waiting for complete response
- **Feels alive** - Mimics Claude Code experience

### Why In-Memory First?
- **Fast** - No database overhead for MVP
- **Simple** - Easier to debug and test
- **Upgradeable** - Can add SQLite/Postgres later

### Why Intent Detection?
- **Smart routing** - Automatic agent selection
- **User-friendly** - No manual mode switching
- **Flexible** - Natural language understanding

## 🚀 Getting Started (Quick)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install ink ink-text-input ink-spinner ink-box chalk better-sqlite3 uuid node-fetch

# 2. Copy files to project
# (See SETUP.md for detailed file locations)

# 3. Update package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "tui": "tsx src/tui/conversational-tui.tsx"
  }
}

# 4. Run it!
pnpm tui
```

**That's it!** You now have a Claude Code-style conversational interface.

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **In-Memory Storage** - History lost on restart
   - *Solution*: Upgrade to SQLite (Phase 3)

2. **No Multi-Line Input** - Press Enter sends immediately
   - *Solution*: Add Shift+Enter support (Phase 2)

3. **Basic Text Search** - No advanced query syntax
   - *Solution*: Add SQLite FTS5 (Phase 3)

4. **Terminal Compatibility** - Some terminals may render differently
   - *Solution*: Test on common terminals (iTerm2, Terminal.app, Alacritty)
