# Debug Analyzer Skill

This skill helps analyze code for bugs, errors, and provides debugging guidance.

## When to Use

- When code is crashing or throwing exceptions
- When debugging complex issues
- When analyzing error logs
- When troubleshooting performance problems
- When reviewing code for potential bugs

## Capabilities

1. **Error Analysis**: Analyze stack traces and error messages
2. **Code Review**: Review code for common bugs and issues
3. **Debugging Strategies**: Suggest debugging approaches
4. **Log Analysis**: Parse and interpret log files
5. **Root Cause Analysis**: Help identify underlying issues

## Usage Examples

### Analyze an Error
```
I'm getting this error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
```

### Debug Performance
```
My application is running slowly, can you help debug the performance?
```

### Review Code for Bugs
```
Can you review this code for potential bugs?
[paste code]
```

## Best Practices

- Provide full error messages and stack traces
- Include relevant code context
- Describe what you expected vs what happened
- Share any recent changes that might be related
